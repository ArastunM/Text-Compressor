## Text Compressor
Text Compressor is a java based application used to compress and decompress 
given text files on command

An average of 45% copmression size reduction is maintained


## Prerequisites
[Java version 15.0.1](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/15/) 
was used for development


## Installation
The project only utilizes java built-in packages


## Getting Started
Before the project is run, it should be ensured 
that the necessary classes/files are within appropriate
directories

The files can be downloaded from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArastunM/Text-Compressor.git)

The directory should look as below:

```
+-- README.md
+-- LICENSE.txt
+-- src
|   +-- HuffmanCompress.class
|   +-- HuffmanCompress.java
|   +-- HuffmanDecompress.class
|   +-- HuffmanDecompress.java
|   +-- Node.class
|   +-- Node.java
|   +-- TextFile.class
|   +-- TextFile.java
|   +-- Tree.class
|   +-- Tree.java
|   +-- TreeNode.class
+-- datasets
|   +-- sample.txt (text files to compress)
+-- javadoc
```

# HOW TO COMPRESS TEXT FILES USING TEXT COMPRESSION
1. Open command line interface and navigate to the directoy of the java class
>> cd ...\Text Compression\src

2. Run the HuffmanCompress.class
>> java HuffmanCompress

3. Enter the full path of the text file to be compressed
Ideally the text file should be located inside "datasets" folder
>> ...\Text Compression\datasets\sample.txt
Or (provided current file structure is kept)
>> ..\datasets\sample.txt

# HOW TO DECOMPRESS TEXT FILES USING TEXT COMPRESSION
1. Follow step 1. above

2. Run the HuffmanDecompress.class
>> java HuffmanDecompress

3. Enter the full path of the text file to be decompressed
>> ...\Text Compression\datasets\sample_compressed.txt
Or (provided current file structure is kept)
>> ..\datasets\sample_compressed.txt

NOTE: If name of the compressed file is to be changed 
so should the name of sample_compressed_list


## Used Classes

- **[HuffmanCompress.class]** -
